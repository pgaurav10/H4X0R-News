Hacker News is a news application that provides users with real-time updates from the Y Combinator API. The app offers a streamlined user experience through SwiftUI, leveraging a TableView to display news articles within a WebView. Key features of the app include:

## Live Data Collection
Hacker News fetches live data from the Y Combinator API, ensuring users have access to the latest news articles and updates from the Hacker News community.

## SwiftUI Implementation
The app is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. This allows for a declarative and intuitive approach to UI development.

## TableView for News Display
 Hacker News utilizes a TableView to present news articles in a structured and organized format. Each cell within the TableView contains information such as the article title, author, and publication date.

## WebView for Article Viewing 
When users select a news article from the TableView, Hacker News utilizes a WebView to display the full article content within the app. This provides a seamless reading experience without requiring users to navigate to an external browser.
